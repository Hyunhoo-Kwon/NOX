What is SDN?
Software-defined networking (SDN) is an approach to computer networking that allows network administrators to manage network services through abstraction of lower-level functionality. SDN is meant to address the fact that the static architecture of traditional networks doesn't support the dynamic, scalable computing and storage needs of more modern computing environments such as data centers. This is done by decoupling or disassociating the system that makes decisions about where traffic is sent (the control plane) from the underlying systems that forward traffic to the selected destination (the data plane).

What is NOX?
NOX is the original OpenFlow controller. It serves as a network control platform, that provides a high level programmatic interface for management and the development of network control applications. Its system-wide abstractions turn networking into a software problem.
